# Rpi_automated_garden

These are python files used in my home garden automation project.

The Raspberry Pi B+ sits in a weather proof box in my backyard with a weather proof thermometer, soil moisture sensor, and relay. The raspberry pi will take the temperature, check to see if the plants have been watered at all today, and then check the time to determine what it should do. If it needs to water it will kick power through the relay to the air pump that pushes air into a jar that pushes the water up through the pipes into the garden.

Much larger scale in the works mixing in a weather station to take multiple pieces of data into accountability fo when the plants and backyard need to be watered.
